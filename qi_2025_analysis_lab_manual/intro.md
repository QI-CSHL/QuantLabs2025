# Welcome to QI 

We hope you enjoy this year's labs! This book will populate with more labs over the next two weeks.

Please note - while we know many excellent commercial software options exist, we have chosen to focus on open-source free tools that you can access at home without any paid software license. Bioimage analysis has a tremendously large, friendly, and robust community for making such software tools - you can explore many such tools (or just post, "here's my picture, here's my question, what is the right tool to use?") at the Scientific Community Image Forum - https://forum.image.sc . 

If you find the possible number of tools to start from overwhelming, you aren't alone! We have [curated some recommendations in the Bioimaging Guide](https://www.bioimagingguide.org/03_Image_analysis/Software.html) that we think you may find helpful.
